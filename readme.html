<h2>Widget-Ready Areas</h2>
<p>Charity Theme has 16 widget-ready areas, called <em>Asides</em>, that can be used creatively to customize your theme.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Primary Aside</h3>
<p>Located immediately after the content area in the markup. Typically used as a sidebar. By default it contains <em>Search</em>, <em>Pages</em>, <em>Categories</em> and <em>Archives</em> widgets. Use the widgets panel under <code>Design</code> to add your own widgets and override the default.</p></li>
<li><h3>Secondary Aside</h3>
<p>Located immediately after the Primary Aside in the markup. Typically used as a sidebar. By default it contains <em>Links</em>, <em>RSS Feeds</em> and <em>Meta</em> widgets. Use the widgets panel under <code>Design</code> to add your own widgets and override the default.</p></li>
<li><h3>Subsidiary Asides</h3>
<p>Located in the footer. Empty of widgets by default, they will not appear in the theme markup until you add a widget.</p></li>
<li><h3>Index Asides</h3>
<p>Located in the content area of the index, or blog page. Empty of widgets by default, they will not appear in the theme markup until you add a widget. The location of the <em>Index Insert</em>, which appears between posts, is controlled from the theme options page. The default position sets it to appear after the second post.</p></li>
